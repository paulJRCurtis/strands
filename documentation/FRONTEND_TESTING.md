# Frontend Testing Recommendations

## 1. Unit Testing (Vitest + Vue Test Utils)
- Component behavior testing
- Service/API mocking
- Coverage reporting
- Fast feedback loop

## 2. Integration Testing
- Component interaction testing
- API integration with mock backend
- User workflow testing

## 3. E2E Testing (Playwright)
- Full user journey testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Real file upload scenarios
- UI interaction validation

## 4. Additional Testing Tools
```bash
# Visual regression testing
npm install --save-dev @storybook/vue3 chromatic

# Accessibility testing  
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/playwright

# Performance testing
npm install --save-dev lighthouse-ci
```

## 5. Test Commands
```bash
npm run test              # Unit tests
npm run test:coverage     # Coverage report
npm run e2e              # E2E tests
npm run lint             # Code quality
```

## 6. CI/CD Integration
The tests integrate with your Jenkins pipeline:
- Unit tests run in parallel with backend tests
- Coverage reports sent to SonarQube
- E2E tests validate deployment success
- Performance metrics tracked in Datadog
