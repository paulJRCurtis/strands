The project has been successfully created based on the high-level design document. Here's what was built:

Project Structure
Backend: FastAPI-based coordinator with specialized security agents

Frontend: Vue.js dashboard for file upload and results visualization

Infrastructure: Terraform configurations for AWS deployment

Agents: Network, data flow, infrastructure, and code security agents

Key Components Created
Coordinator & Agents
CoordinatorAgent: Orchestrates the analysis workflow

NetworkSecurityAgent: Analyzes network configurations and firewall rules

DataFlowAgent: Checks encryption and PII protection

InfrastructureAgent: Reviews IAM policies and cloud configurations

CodeSecurityAgent: Performs static security analysis

ReportGeneratorAgent: Consolidates findings with risk scoring

Frontend Dashboard
Vue.js application with file upload interface

Real-time analysis results display

Findings grouped by severity levels

Infrastructure
Terraform configurations for ECS, S3, DynamoDB

Docker containerization setup

AWS deployment ready

Example Usage
An example_architecture.json file is included to test the platform with common security issues like:

Unencrypted data flows

Overly permissive firewall rules

Public storage buckets

Wildcard IAM permissions

The platform is ready to analyze architecture files and identify security vulnerabilities using the multi-agent approach outlined in your design document.
