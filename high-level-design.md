# Multi-Agent Architecture Security Analysis Platform

## Overview
A distributed web application that leverages multiple AI agents to analyze software architectures and identify security vulnerabilities. Built using Strands framework for agent orchestration and deployed on AWS for scalability.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Web Interface Layer
- **Frontend**: Vue-based dashboard for architecture upload and results visualization
- **API Gateway**: RESTful endpoints for client-server communication
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication and authorization

#### 2. Agent Orchestration (Strands)
- **Coordinator Agent**: Manages workflow and delegates tasks to specialist agents
- **Architecture Parser Agent**: Processes and normalizes input architectures (diagrams, code, configs)
- **Security Analysis Agents**:
  - Network Security Agent: Analyzes network topology and access controls
  - Data Flow Agent: Identifies sensitive data paths and encryption gaps
  - Infrastructure Agent: Reviews cloud configurations and IAM policies
  - Code Security Agent: Performs static analysis on application code
- **Report Generator Agent**: Consolidates findings into actionable reports

#### 3. Processing Pipeline
```
Architecture Input → Parser → Security Agents → Analysis → Report Generation → Results
```

### AWS Deployment Architecture

#### Compute Services
- **ECS Fargate**: Containerized agent execution environment
- **Lambda**: Serverless functions for lightweight processing tasks
- **API Gateway**: Managed API endpoints with throttling and monitoring

#### Storage & Data
- **S3**: Architecture files, analysis results, and static assets
- **DynamoDB**: User sessions, job status, and metadata
- **ElastiCache**: Caching layer for frequently accessed data

#### Security & Monitoring
- **Cognito**: User authentication and management
- **CloudWatch**: Logging, monitoring, and alerting
- **WAF**: Web application firewall protection
- **Secrets Manager**: Secure storage of API keys and credentials

#### Networking
- **VPC**: Isolated network environment
- **ALB**: Application load balancer with SSL termination
- **CloudFront**: CDN for global content delivery

## Agent Workflow

### 1. Input Processing
- User uploads architecture (JSON, YAML, diagrams, or code repositories)
- Parser Agent validates and normalizes input format
- Coordinator Agent creates analysis job and task queue

### 2. Parallel Analysis
- Multiple security agents analyze different aspects simultaneously
- Each agent maintains specialized knowledge base and rules engine
- Agents communicate findings through shared context

### 3. Result Synthesis
- Report Generator Agent consolidates all findings
- Risk scoring and prioritization based on severity and impact
- Generates remediation recommendations

## Security Analysis Capabilities

### Network Security
- Firewall rule analysis
- Network segmentation validation
- Exposed service identification
- Traffic flow security assessment

### Data Protection
- Encryption in transit and at rest verification
- Data classification and handling compliance
- PII exposure detection
- Backup and recovery security

### Infrastructure Security
- Cloud configuration best practices
- IAM policy analysis
- Resource access controls
- Compliance framework alignment (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)

### Application Security
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability detection
- Authentication and authorization flaws
- Input validation and sanitization
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Scalability & Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- Auto-scaling ECS services based on queue depth
- Lambda concurrency limits for burst capacity
- DynamoDB on-demand scaling

### Performance Optimization
- Parallel agent execution
- Caching of common analysis patterns
- Asynchronous processing with status updates
- Result streaming for large analyses

## Deployment Strategy

### Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform/CloudFormation templates
- Environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
- Automated CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline

### Container Strategy
- Docker images for each agent type
- ECR for container registry
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates

### Monitoring & Observability
- Distributed tracing with X-Ray
- Custom CloudWatch metrics for agent performance
- Automated alerting for system health
- Cost monitoring and optimization

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure file upload with virus scanning
- Data retention policies and automated cleanup
- GDPR compliance for user data

### Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced AI Capabilities
- Machine learning models for pattern recognition
- Natural language processing for documentation analysis
- Continuous learning from analysis feedback

### Integration Ecosystem
- CI/CD pipeline integrations
- SIEM system connectors
- Ticketing system integration for remediation tracking
- Third-party security tool APIs
